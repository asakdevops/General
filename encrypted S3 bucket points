If the S3 bucket is encrypted by AWS S3 encryption service, then in that case we can easily perform any action on it (copy,sync etc).
If the s3 bucket is encrypted by KMS then we need to add certain parameters while performing s3 actions
s3 cp <file1> s3://bucket-namep/ --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id <KMS Key-id>
